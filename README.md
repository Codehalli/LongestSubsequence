Purpose for this project was to create a program that will find the longest common Subsequence between two sequences X and Y.  Key Concepts in this program were object oriented programming where the class was LCS. The main important concepts in the is project was learning to parse using a struct, building a C table , using back tracking algorithm, and using a recurrsive function to find the subsequence.
